# Bucky

## Getting started
In theory, Bucky would be hosted on the World Wide Web and you would just visit some URL, but that costs money! 
To get Bucky up and running on your system, all that you will need is ![Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a terminal / cmd prompt, and a modern web browser.

### Downloading and installing Node.js
To download Node.js go to ![https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the download and installation instructions.
To see if Node.js has successfully installed on your machine simply open up a terminal / cmd prompt and type:
```
node
```
If you see a welcome message and a version number, you're all set.

### Downloading this repository
If you have git installed on your device simply run:
```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelvMorrison/Bucky.git
```
in the directory of your choosing.

If you don't have git installed you can download this repsository by downloading it as a ![.zip](https://github.com/MichaelvMorrison/Bucky/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

### Installing npm packages
Once you have the repository downloaded you'll need to install the required npm packages by opening a terminal / cmd prompt in the home directory and running:
```
npm i
```

### Starting the Server
With a terminal / cmd prompt still running in the home directory, run:
```
npm run start
```
